# nobodyplace

## Intro

After being an intern for six months in Tencent, I decided to actually accomplish something that benefits me in both real life and coding ability.
The reason I choose web application is the convenience for me to either use it or develop it.
I'm not saying that I'm familiar with VUE, JavaScript or etc., but the languages and structures are very easy to learn, and the website itself is frequently used.

So, nobodyplace is born.
